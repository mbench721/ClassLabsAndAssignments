//	c.	User must be able to easily input values for an arbitrary amount of matrices.
//	d.	User must be able to choose what operations they wish to do with which matrices.
//	e.	User can store result of an operation in a new matrix (except for operations that produce a scalar).
//	3-	Where the operation is not defined, your program should give an error.
